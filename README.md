# NAND to Tetris Project

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the NAND to Tetris course, which aims to build a computer from scratch starting with basic logic gates (NAND gates) all the way up to building a simple computer architecture.

## Course Overview

The NAND to Tetris course is an educational program that takes you through a journey of understanding computer architecture from the ground up. The course covers various aspects, including:

- Building logic gates using NAND gates
- Constructing a central processing unit (CPU)
- Creating a computer memory
- Designing an assembler
- Developing a virtual machine (VM)
- Building a compiler
- Assembling a high-level language
- And finally, creating a game using the tools and languages developed throughout the course

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a different project or module of the course. Here's a brief overview:

- `01-Logic-Gates`: Contains implementations of basic logic gates using NAND gates.
- `02-CPU`: Covers the construction of a simple CPU.
- `03-Memory`: Deals with computer memory creation.
- `04-Assembler`: Focuses on building an assembler.
- `05-VM`: Involves the development of a virtual machine.
- `06-Compiler`: Covers the creation of a compiler.
- `07-High-Level-Language`: Involves assembling a high-level language.
- `08-Game`: Contains the final project - a game built using the tools and languages developed in the course.

Each folder contains its own README file with specific details and instructions related to that particular project/module.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow the instructions provided in each project's README file. Ensure you have the necessary software, tools, and dependencies installed as specified.
